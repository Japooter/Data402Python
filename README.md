# Python: Where to start
In this guide, we are going to cover the fundamentals of Python as a programming language.

To be sure that all that you can find what you want, here is a list of the topics that will be covered. Simply go to what area of the document you would like to visit.

	- Introduction/The starting point
	- Commenting code
	- Data Types
	- Numbers and Mathematical Operators
	- Strings
	- Boolean and Equality Operators
	- Variables
	- Concatenation and String Methods
	- Control Flow
	- Collections, Lists and Dictionaries
	- Loops (While, For)
	- Functions

Just remember: Python can be a puzzle. Do not panic if you are stuck, just logically think about all of the information you know!


## Introduction/The starting point

We will assume that you have a code editor on hand when beginning this tutorial, but if you do not then you *must* get one as soon as possible. Standard text editors, while they do accept python code, do not allow you to have extra support for problems that may arise, such as trying to remember where a bracket would need to go (more on that later).

For now, ensure that you have one and, to ensure that you can run the code you create, an ability to run any code you write. PyCharm, recommended by many, has this capability built in, but there are plenty of alternatives you can use.
